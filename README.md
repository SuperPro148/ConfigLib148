## ConfigLib148

I made a crappy config library for myself.
I do not recommend using this for your own mods.
If you do use it, I recommend YetAnotherConfigLib for config screen generation.
Examples and documentation can be found in src/test.

Currently supports:
Booleans, Integers, Longs, Floats, Doubles, custom Enums
